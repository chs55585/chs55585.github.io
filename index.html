<p>Hello, I'm Hank Strickland. I am an avid basketball fan, and
my favorite player is LeBron James. His team, the Cleveland Cavaliers,
won the 2016 NBA title. I took a keen interest in the playoffs and
the Finals. This web-page is a dedication to the 2016 playoffs,
recounting each playoff series outcome and the top five leaders
in points per game for the whole playoffs.</p>

<p>Heading into the NBA playoffs, four NBA teams looked to be in a
position to contend for the Larry O'Brien Trophy that would be awarded
to the Finals winner in late June. 
<br> Those teams (<i>listed in order of Title odds</i>) were:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Golden State Warriors</li>
	<li>Cleveland Cavaliers</li>
	<li>San Antonio Spurs</li>
	<li>Oklahoma City Thunder</li>
</ol>

<H2>Western Conference Playoffs</H2>
<H3>First Round Results</H3>
<p>GSW defeat HOU, LAC defeat Blazers, OKC defeat Dallas, SAS defeat Memphis.</p>
<H3>Second Round Results</H3>
<p>GSW defeat Blazers, OKC defeat SAS.</P>
<H3>Western Conference Finals</H3>
<P>GSW defeat OKC.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the Golden State Warriors emerged from a loaded Western Conference.
They had momentum, coming off three straight victories against the Oklahoma City Thunder to save their season from the grip of a 3-1 deficit,
but they had paid a physical toll in completing this improbable comeback.</p>

<H2>Eastern Conference Playoffs</H2>
<H3>First Round Results</H3>
<p>CLE defeat DET, ATL defeat BOS, MIA defeat CHA, TOR defeat IND.</p>
<H3>Second Round Results</H3>
<p>CLE defeat ATL, TOR defeat MIA.</p>
<H3>Eastern Conference Finals</H3>
<p>CLE defeat TOR.</p>

<p>The Cleveland Cavaliers had already inked their ticket to the Finals before the Warriors finished off the Thunder.
They had remained relatively untested in the Eastern playoffs, but the Finals would prove to be another story entirely.</p>

<H2>NBA Finals</H2>

<p>While few analysts gave Cleveland any chance in the upcoming series,
ESPN's Zach Lowe offered a vaguely positive take - still picking the Warriors,
but noting the Cavs ability:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/15888230/this-matchup-cavs-warriors-what-saw-2015">
<p>The Cavs will inflict damage. They are good enough to win this series. The Warriors have been just a bit better all season, and they hold the trump card of playing Game 7 at home.</p>
</blockquote>

<P><b>CLE defeat GSW.</b></P>

<p>The Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the Golden State Warriors in heroic 
fashion in a seven game series. In doing so, the team
solidified its respective place in NBA lore as the only team to win the Finals after trailing 3-1.</P>
<P><em>LeBron James closed the series in truely dominant fashion, 
reaffirming his status as an all-time great player.</em></p>

<p>Kyrie Irving would later say:
<q>I watched <b>Beethoven</b> tonight right now of LeBron James... compose the game.</q>
